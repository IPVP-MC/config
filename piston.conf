# # This is the primary configuration for Piston, a powerful server core
# # that handles a majority of Hardcore Faction server functions.
#
# # IPVP.ORG
# # http://ipvp.org

# The piston configuration has many different formats available.
#
# All messages that are
# considered a String value are colored when fetched, meaning that '&' color formatting
# is available on any String.
#
# There are a few different data structure types available in the configuration, and
# are defined in a specific way. Straying away from these defined structures will cause
# errors in code execution so be careful when implementing. These are the following
# structures available, and the proper ways to define them. The data type required in
# the structure fields are provided.
#
# The primary HOCON configuration library also provides certain structures (ie. Duration) and mechanisms
# available in this configuration. These can be researched here: https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md
