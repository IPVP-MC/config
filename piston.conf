# # This is the primary configuration for Piston, a powerful server core
# # that handles a majority of Hardcore Faction server functions.
#
# # IPVP.ORG
# # http://ipvp.org

# The piston configuration has many different formats available.
#
# All messages that are
# considered a String value are colored when fetched, meaning that '&' color formatting
# is available on any String.
#
# There are a few different data structure types available in the configuration, and
# are defined in a specific way. Straying away from these defined structures will cause
# errors in code execution so be careful when implementing. These are the following
# structures available, and the proper ways to define them. The data type required in
# the structure fields are provided.
#
# The primary HOCON configuration library also provides certain structures (ie. Duration) and mechanisms
# available in this configuration. These can be researched here: https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md

        # Configuration of passive and active potion effects that can be
        # applied to players. Currently supports Bard and Archer classes.
        #
        # Each effect defined must contain an energy usage value and an item
        # type that triggers the effect. Additionally, each section has the
        # option to contain an active effect that is applied by clicking the
        # item, consuming the energy, or a passive effect that is applied
        # simply by holding the item.
        #
        # Options to prevent the effect from being applied to the player
        # holding the item are provided through the "active-holder" and
        # "passive-holder" Boolean values, which will restrict their effects
        # from the kit holder.
        #
        # The effects under each class are defined in their own sub-section and
        # must follow this format:
        #   energy: Integer
        #   material: org.bukkit.Material
        #   active: PotionEffect (OPTIONAL)
        #   passive: PotionEffect (OPTIONAL)
        #   active-holder: Boolean (OPTIONAL)
        #   passive-holder: Boolean (OPTIONAL)
        #
        # Example:
        # sugar {
        #   energy = 10
        #   material = SUGAR
        #   active {
